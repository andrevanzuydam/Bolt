# [WIP] Bolt
Bolt protocol library over TCP socket. Bolt protocol is primary used for communication with [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) Graph database. The documentation is available at https://boltprotocol.org/v1/

## Author note
I really like Neo4j and I wanted to use it with PHP. But when I looked on official php library, I was really disappointed. Too much dependencies. I don't like if I need to install 10 things because of one. First I decided to use HTTP API for communication, but isn't fast enough. I went through bolt protocol documentation and I said to myself, why not to create own simple library?

## Requirements
PHP >= 7.1  
PHP extension sockets https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php

## Support
